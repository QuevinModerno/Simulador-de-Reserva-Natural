# Simulador-de-Reserva-Natural

Project Overview
This project is a Natural Reserve Simulator developed in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The simulation models a natural reserve populated with various animals that exhibit autonomous behaviors such as movement, feeding, reproduction, and interaction with their environment. Users interact with the simulator via text commands, influencing the animals and the reserve's state.

Features
Polymorphic Animal System: Multiple species of animals with unique behaviors, such as rabbits, wolves, sheep, and kangaroos.
Food System: Different types of food (e.g., grass, carcass, vegetables) with varying nutritional and toxic properties.
Simulation of Time: The simulation progresses in discrete time steps, with animals reacting to their environment and changing states.
User Interaction: Users can create animals, feed them, or remove elements using simple text commands. The simulation state updates after every user command.
Text-based Interface: The interface operates in text mode, with the reserve and its elements visually represented on the console.
Requirements
C++ Standard: The project uses C++11 or later. Ensure that your compiler supports this standard.
Development Environment: The project can be compiled and run using any C++ development environment (e.g., CLion, Visual Studio, or GCC/Clang).
